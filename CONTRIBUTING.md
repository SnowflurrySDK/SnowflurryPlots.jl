## Pull Request Process and Code Review

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) has
information on using pull requests.

The preferred manner for submitting pull requests is for users to fork
the Snowflurry [repo](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflurry.jl) and then use a
branch from this fork to create a pull request to the main Snowflurry repo.

The basic process for setting up a fork is

1.  Fork the Snowflurry repo (Fork button in upper right corner of
    [repo page](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflurry.jl)).
    Forking creates a new github repo at the location
    `https://github.com/USERNAME/Snowflurry.jl` where `USERNAME` is
    your github id. Use the directions on the
    [development page](docs/dev/development.md) to download a copy to
    your local machine. You need only do this once.
1.  Checkout master and create a new branch from this master
    ```shell
    git checkout master -b new_branch_name
    ```
    where `new_branch_name` is the name of your new branch.
1.  Do your work and commit your changes to this branch.
1.  If you have drifted out of sync with the master from the
    main Snowflurry repo you may need to merge in changes. To do this,
    first update your local master and then merge the local master
    into your branch:

    ````shell # Track the upstream repo (if your local repo hasn't):
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflurry.jl.git

        # Update your local master.
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout master
        git merge upstream/master
        # Merge local master into your branch.
        git checkout new_branch_name
        git merge master
        ```
        You may need to fix merge conflicts for both of these merge
        commands.

    ````

1.  Finally, push your change to your clone
    ```shell
    git push origin new_branch_name
    ```
1.  Now when you navigate to the Snowflurry page on github,
    [https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflurry.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflurry.jl)
    you should see the option to create a new pull request from
    your clone repository. Alternatively you can create the pull request
    by navigating to the "Pull requests" tab in the page, and selecting
    the appropriate branches.
1.  The reviewer will comment on your code and may ask for changes,
    you can perform these locally, and then push the new commit following
    the same process as above.

## Julia Coding Style Guide

We adhere to Julia recommanded [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/). Please consult this document before getting started!

## Code Testing Standards

When a pull request is created or updated, various automatic checks will
run to ensure that the change won't break Snowflurry and meets our coding standards.

Cirq contains a continuous integration tool to verify testing. See our
[development page](docs/dev/development.md) on how to run the continuous
integration checks locally.

Please be aware of the following code standards that will be applied to any
new changes.

- **Tests**.
  Existing tests must continue to pass (or be updated) when new changes are
  introduced. You have two ways to run the unittests:

1. Use `Pkg.test`:
   Type the following in the REPL:

```julia
julia>using Pkg; Pkg.test("Snowflurry"; coverage=true)
```

2. Run `test/runtests.jl`: Include the `test/runtests.jl` script in the REPL:

```julia
julia> include("test/runtests.jl")
Test Summary: | Pass  Total
ket           |    7      7
Test Summary: | Pass  Total
multi_body    |    1      1
Test Summary: | Pass  Total
cnot          |    1      1
Test Summary:  | Pass  Total
phase_kickback |    1      1
```

- **Coverage**.
  Code should be covered by tests.
  We use [Coverage.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/Coverage.jl) to compute
  coverage. We don't require 100% coverage, but expect better than 80% code coverage.
- **VS Code Code Style**.
  We highly recommand developing the code in VS Code and use its [Julia Formatter Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=singularitti.vscode-julia-formatter).
